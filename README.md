# Go Algorithms

This repository goes through [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) from Front End Masters and attempts to implement some of the data structures and algorithms in Go. Notes from the course also live here. 

This is to help learn Go. Some of the data structures and algorithms might already be implemented in the Go standard library but will be implemented in a simple manner just to learn. They are not implemented to attempt to replace or be better than the current standard library.
